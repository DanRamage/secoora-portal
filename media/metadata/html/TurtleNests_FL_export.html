The SNBS was initiated in 1979 under a cooperative agreement between FWC and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Its purpose is to document the total distribution, seasonality, and abundance of nesting by sea turtles in Florida. Three species of sea turtles, the loggerhead (Caretta caretta), the green turtle (Chelonia mydas), and the leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), nest regularly on Florida's beaches. Two other species, Kemp&#x2019;s ridley (Lepidochelys kempii) and the hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) also nest but in very small numbers. All the species are listed as either Threatened or Endangered under the Endangered Species Act. Survey data are derived from observations of tracks and other nesting signs left on the beach by sea turtles. Species identifications and determinations of nesting vs. non-nesting emergences are based on the evaluation of visible features of the track and the nest. Data are gathered on more than 200 beaches through a network of permit holders consisting of private conservation groups, volunteers, consultants, academics, local governments, federal agencies, and the Florida Park Service. Nest density classifications of low/medium/ high were developed for loggerheads, green turtles and leatherbacks according to quartile ranks. For the loggerhead turtle, ranking was done within genetic subunits; ranks for green turtles and leatherbacks were on a statewide basis. Hawksbill turtles and Kemp&#x2019;s ridleys are denoted only as present or absent on individual beaches. Surveys in the SNBS program may vary with respect to start/stop dates, frequency, duration and beach length between years for a particular beach, as well as between beaches. Survey results are used by managers to evaluate and minimize impacts to turtles and their nests due to human activities such as coastal construction, beach renourishment, and recreation, as well as to identify important areas for enhanced protection or land acquisition."/><meta name="dc.contributor" content="Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission-Fish and Wildlife Research Institute"/><meta name="dc.date" content="20130206"/><meta name="dc.type" content="data.vector digital data"/><meta name="dc.coverage.x.min" scheme="DD" content="-81.859218"/><meta name="dc.coverage.x.max" scheme="DD" content="-79.994380"/><meta name="dc.coverage.y.min" scheme="DD" content="24.544163"/><meta name="dc.coverage.y.max" scheme="DD" content="30.706127"/><meta name="dc.coverage.t.min" content="20060101"/><meta name="dc.coverage.t.max" content="20111231"/><meta name="dc.rights" content="Access constraints: None;  Use constraints: All data must be verified by Principle Investigator or Group Database Analyst prior to release.

Data are gathered on more than 200 beaches through a network of permit holders consisting of private conservation groups, volunteers, consultants, academics, local governments, federal agencies, and the Florida Park Service. Annual nest counts for the state represent a minimum estimate because not all nesting activity is recorded on surveyed beaches and not all nesting beaches in Florida are surveyed.  Nest density classifications of &#8220;low&#8221;, &#8220;medium&#8221; and &#8220;high&#8221; were developed for loggerheads, green turtles and leatherbacks according to quartile ranks. For the loggerhead turtle, ranking was done within genetic subunits; ranks for green turtles and leatherbacks were on a statewide basis. Hawksbill turtles and Kemp&#8217;s ridleys were denoted only as present or absent on individual beaches. Surveys in the SNBS program may vary with respect to start/stop dates, frequency, duration and beach length between years for a particular beach, as well as between beaches. This variability in the surveys, combined with the dynamic nature of sea turtle nesting activity, make the quartile ranking system for the beaches, rather than average nesting densities over a small number of years, a more appropriate measure of the level of nesting activity that takes place on a particular beach. Survey results are used by managers to evaluate and minimize impacts to turtles and their nests due to human activities such as coastal construction, beach renourishment, and recreation, as well as to identify important areas for enhanced protection or land acquisition. Direct contact by managers with the appropriate state data provider is highly recommended to obtain more detailed information about the surveys on a particular beach.</pre></dd><dt><i>Supplemental_Information: </i></dt><dd><pre id="fixvalue">FWC&#8217;s Statewide Nesting Beach Survey program encompassed an annual average of 1.318 km of nesting beach during the referenced period. This included most, but not all, of the nesting beaches in the state, with the most significant gap in coverage in the Everglades region of Monroe County.   Annual nest counts for the state represent a minimum estimate because not all nesting activity is recorded on surveyed beaches and not all nesting beaches in Florida are surveyed.  It should be noted that sea turtles may use any sandy beaches for nesting. There are limitations to the use of the SNBS database imposed by the data collection methodology employed. Surveys in the SNBS program may vary with respect to start/stop dates, frequency, duration and beach length between years for a particular beach, as well as between beaches, making the data inappropriate for assessing population trends.  Trend evaluation is the goal of a complementary FWRI program, the Index Nesting Beach Survey program (INBS) where consistency in survey effort is accomplished by following a regime of 7 days/week monitoring during a set 109-day window, and maintaining consistent survey boundaries.

With some exceptions, including surveys on geographically remote beaches, SNBS surveys typically capture the majority of nesting activity on a particular beach. Surveys with less than 7 day/week frequency may result in underestimated nest totals; however, most surveyors count all new nests observed when surveys are resumed, thus reducing the error. Tracks are marked as having been evaluated when the surveys are conducted. Determination of nesting success, i.e., whether an emergence has resulted in eggs being deposited, or in a "false crawl", is made using the visible features of the track and nest.  This can be challenging in areas where nest densities are high or in situations where weather has erased the marks left in the sand by the turtle. However, in a test on INBS beaches of the accuracy of surveyors correctly distinguishing between nests and false crawls, the probability that a nest counted by a surveyor was actually a nest was 96%.

Nest density classifications of &#8220;low&#8221;, &#8220;medium&#8221; and &#8220;high&#8221; were determined for each species for each survey area based on average nest densities during the six-year period to which these data apply. Nest density was defined as the number of nests per kilometer of surveyed nesting beach habitat.  Quartile break values at 25 and 75 percent of the observations were used in assigning nesting beaches to the three density categories. Categories were assigned as follows: &#8220;low&#8221; = density values less than or equal to the lower 25%, &#8220;medium&#8221; = nest density values greater than 25% and less than or equal to 75%, and &#8220;high&#8221; = nest density values greater than 75%. Beaches with zero density values were excluded from the quartile ranking calculations. Density classifications for loggerheads (Caretta caretta) were calculated for each of the seven Florida genetic subunits (three on the east coast), after Shamblin et al. (Genetic structure of the southeastern United States loggerhead turtle nesting aggregation: evidence of additional structure within the peninsular Florida recovery unit, 2011, Marine Biology 158:571-587). Green turtle (Chelonia mydas) and Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea) nesting data were both classified relative to all statewide nesting beaches because unique genetic subunits within Florida have not yet been  described for those species. Nest density values were not calculated for Kemp&#8217;s ridleys and hawksbills because of the rareness of nesting by these species.  Use of the quartile-based ranks (low, medium, high) to compare the level of nesting activity across beaches is recommended over the use of average nesting densities due to the variation of survey parameters (e.g., frequency, duration) and the dynamic nature of sea turtle nesting. </pre></dd></dl></dd><dt><i>Time_Period_of_Content: </i></dt><dd><dl><dt><i>Time_Period_Information: </i></dt><dd><dl><dt><i>Range_of_Dates/Times: </i></dt><dd><dl><dt><i>Beginning_Date: </i>20060101</dt><dt><i>Ending_Date: </i>20111231</dt></dl></dd></dl></dd><dt><i>Currentness_Reference: </i></dt><dd><pre id="fixvalue">2006 - 2011 survey seasons</pre></dd></dl></dd><dt><i>Status: </i></dt><dd><dl><dt><i>Progress: </i>In work</dt><dt><i>Maintenance_and_Update_Frequency: </i>None planned</dt></dl></dd><dt><i>Spatial_Domain: </i></dt><dd><dl><dt><i>Bounding_Coordinates: </i></dt><dd><dl><dt><i>West_Bounding_Coordinate: </i>-81.859218</dt><dt><i>East_Bounding_Coordinate: </i>-79.994380</dt><dt><i>North_Bounding_Coordinate: </i>30.706127</dt><dt><i>South_Bounding_Coordinate: </i>24.544163</dt></dl></dd></dl></dd><dt><i>Keywords: </i></dt><dd><dl><dt><i>Theme: </i></dt><dd><dl><dt><i>Theme_Keyword_Thesaurus: </i>None</dt><dt><i>Theme_Keyword: </i>sea turtle nesting</dt></dl></dd></dl></dd><dt><i>Access_Constraints: </i>None</dt><dt><i>Use_Constraints: </i></dt><dd><pre id="fixvalue">All data must be verified by Principle Investigator or Group Database Analyst prior to release.

Nest density was defined as the number of nests per kilometer of surveyed nesting beach habitat. Quartile break values at 25 and 75 percent of the observations were used in assigning nesting beaches to the three density categories. Categories were assigned as follows: &#8220;low&#8221; = density values less than or equal to the lower 25%, &#8220;medium&#8221; = nest density values greater than 25% and less than or equal to 75%, and &#8220;high&#8221; = nest density values greater than 75%. Beaches with zero density values were excluded from the quartile ranking calculations. Density classifications for loggerheads (Caretta caretta) were calculated for each of the seven Florida genetic subunits (three on the east coast), after Shamblin et al. (Genetic structure of the southeastern United States loggerhead turtle nesting aggregation: evidence of additional structure within the peninsular Florida recovery unit, 2011, Marine Biology 158:571-587).</pre></dd><dt><i>Attribute_Definition_Source: </i></dt><dd><pre id="fixvalue">FWC-FWRI</pre></dd></dl></dd><dt><i>Attribute: </i></dt><dd><dl><dt><i>Attribute_Label: </i>cmMeanDens</dt><dt><i>Attribute_Definition: </i></dt><dd><pre id="fixvalue">The mean annual nesting density for green turtles summarized over the survey years covered by these data.

      <abstract>The Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP) is a cooperative state-federal program to design, implement and conduct marine fisheries statistics data collection programs and to integrate those data into a single data management system that will meet the needs of fishery managers, scientists and fishermen. Landings data are collected for each species based on where the species was captured within blocks of the Atlantic Ocean representing 1x1 degree latitude and longitude. This dataset shows all of the 1 x 1 blocks combined into latitude bins for landings data at the species level. Species data can only be presented by latitude bins due to confidentiality limitations. For example, the average total pounds landed per year from 2007 -- 2011 in the region between 24 and 25 degrees N is in the 24 degree bin. In addition to the error checking and quality control and assurance done by the ACCSP Data Team, the data are checked at the state and federal partner level.</abstract>
      <purpose>This GIS dataset was created for the purpose of describing finfish landings by species for different regions of the southeastern United States so that these data can be considered with respect to other data on coastal resources and activities.</purpose>

        <procdesc>Finfish landings data were requested for the southeastern U.S. coast from the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP) for the area ranging from 24 to 37 degrees north latitude for a recent five year period (2007-2011). This dataset provides landings summaries by species for each one degree latitude bin between 24 and 37 degrees north latitudes. These data had to be summarized at the courser one degree latitude bins rather than area code bins due to confidentiality issues. Only the landings for the species representing the top 80% of all finfish landings for the region are provided. The same species noted in the average total finfish landings database are listed with respect to average total pounds landed per one degree latitude bin, for the entire five year period where records could be provided (to meet confidentiality rules), The number of years represented in the five year period for each species is also provided. Species that represented the top 80% of all finfish landings included American shad, Atlantic croaker, ballyhoo, big eye tuna, black sea bass, bluefish, dolphin, flounder, forktail catfishes, gag grouper, greater amberjack, king mackerel, king whiting, little tuny, menhadens, smooth dogfish, Spanish mackerel, spiny dogfish, spot, striped bass, striped mullet, swordfish, trigger fishes, vermillion snapper, and yellowfin tuna.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>GIS Processing: A 1 x 1 degree grid was created using the Fishnet tool. The grids were visually matched to area codes for the southeast, which were added as an attribute. The grids were converted to lines, the intermediate longitude lines were deleted. Then the remaining lines were converted back to polygon to create "latitude bins". Although the original data included other attributes, only average total pounds and number of years per "latitude bin" was included in the final GIS dataset.</procdesc>

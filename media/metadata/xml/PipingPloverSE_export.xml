      <abstract>Polygon shapefile that depicts the piping plover critical habitat units on its wintering grounds. This file does not contain those units that were vacated in North Carolina (2004) or in Texas (2006). The Texas areas have been re-designated (2009) and are in a separate file. The units were created by generalizing or bounding the buffered mapped critical habitat shoreline in an attempt to capture the dynamics of these systems to the recovery date of 2020. Mapped critical habitat shoreline was created by "on-screen"/ "heads-up" digitizing based on 1992-1998 Black &amp; White or Color InfraRed Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads at 1, 3, or 6 meter resolution. Note: The GIS file and the associated coordinates are not the definitive source for determining the critical habitat boundaries for wintering piping plover. As noted in the final rule, the textual unit descriptions constitute the legal source for determining the critical habitat boundaries. The areas included within the boundaries of the GIS file do not follow the legal boundaries of the critical habitat designation. See USE CONSTRAINTS for further information.</abstract>
      <purpose>Final determination of critical habitat on the wintering grounds for the Great Lakes and Northern Great Plains populations of piping plover under court order (Civil No. 1:96-CV02695AER, Civil No. 1:97-CV00777AER).</purpose>
      <supplinf>Piping plovers (Charadrius melodus) are federally listed shorebirds breeding along the north Alantic Coast, the Northern Great Plains, and the Great Lakes regions. The Great Lakes population is federally listed as endangered, while the Atlantic and Northern Great Plains populations are listed as threatened. Piping plovers are considered threatened on their wintering grounds. In the United States these populations winter along the Atlantic Ocean from North Carolina south, along the Gulf coast to Texas, and the Carribean. Piping plovers spend the majority of the year on the wintering grounds. Due to the difficulty of seperating out the populations of piping plover (Great Lakes, Northern Great Plains, and Atlantic) when on their wintering grounds, critical habitat was designated for all wintering piping plover. Critical habitat are areas considered essential for the conservation of a listed species. These areas provide notice to the public and land managers the importance of these areas to the conservation of this species. It does not afford any special protection or restriction other than where federal funding, permits, licenses, authorizations, or actions occur or are required.</supplinf>

    <useconst>The 'S_STATUS' attribute field should be used to show listing status of each polygon. The legal boundaries are verbally described in the Federal Register. The GIS file, map products and the associated coordinates are not the definitive source for determining the critical habitat boundaries for wintering piping plover. As noted in the final rule, the textual unit descriptions constitute the legal source for determining the critical habitat boundaries. The areas included within the boundaries of the GIS file do not follow the legal boundaries of the critical habitat designation for the following reasons: 1) the waterward boundary of Mean Lower Low Water (MLLW) has not been incorporated into the GIS file because a definitive source for the MLLW line across the entire wintering range was unavailable, therefore, the areas defined by the GIS file are known to extend out into areas of open water that are not utilized by the piping plover and are not designated as critical habitat, and 2) the landward boundary where densely vegetated habitat, not used by the piping plover, begins and where constituent elements do not occur were not digitized and, therefore, areas included within the GIS file may extend landward into areas not designated as critical habitat. Users of the GIS file are cautioned to refer to the final textual unit descriptions provided in the final rule as the definitive source in determining critical habitat areas. Additionally, interested parties are encouraged to contact the Service for a definitive finding of whether a location is within critical habitat (See Technical/Consultative Contacts:). This geospatial dataset is the final critical habitat units layer for wintering piping plovers. These data are to be used only in the context of the definition and purpose of critical habitat. This primarily relates to Section 7 consultation under the Endangered Species Act. These data may be used for planning and land management purposes. They are not to be used for legal survey use.</useconst>

    <complete>The data represents sites with constituent elements used by piping plover in the wintering grounds. Mapped sites were based on information provided by state and federal biologists, Christmas Bird counts, and the 1991 and 1996 International Piping Plover surveys. Omissions may be possible due to the extent of coverage and difficulty of surveying all coastal areas.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>Horizontal accuracy was not tested; however, data was created by digiziting on screen using 1 meter Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads at a 1:5000 view scale. Therefore, it is assumed that the accuracy is within National Map Accuracy Standards of 10m at the 95% C.I. for horizontal accuracy.</horizpar>

The following processing steps were used to create the critical habitat unit boundaries in ArcView and Arc/Info software: 1). The mapped critical habitat shoreline shapefile or coverage was buffered by the buffering distance (calculated by the sum of: the erosion or accretion rate * years from present to the recovery date + erosion or accretion rate * the number of years from present to the date of the photography + doqq error). 2). The newly created buffer polygons were either generalized or bounded by doing on-screen digitizing. 3). Line defining land and water was digitized by hand or by inputting into the layer. 4). Attributes were added to the layer by either manual entry or by populating from a source file.</procdesc>

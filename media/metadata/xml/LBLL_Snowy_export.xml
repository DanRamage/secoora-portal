      <abstract>Marine Spatial Data: This dataset came from the Marine Resources Monitoring, Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) program which has conducted fisheries-independent research for the last 40 years off the southeastern United States. This dataset was based on a five year time frame (2006-2010). The data were summarized into 1 x 1 minute latitude/longitude grids which provide the number of collections, percent occurrence, mean catch per unit effort (CPUE), and the coefficient of variance for the CPUE. General MARMAP overview: Annual MARMAP cruises to assess relative abundance of reef fishes in the sponge-coral and shelf edge (live bottom) habitats of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) have been conducted since 1978. MARMAP currently samples natural live bottom habitat from Cape Lookout, NC to the Ft. Pierce area, FL. The current main MARMAP objectives are to: 1.) sample reef fishes in the snapper-grouper complex at using a variety of gears in live bottom, rocky outcrop, high relief, and mud bottom habitats, 2.) collect detailed data for time series description of species for annual composition and relative abundance, 3.) obtain population characteristics on fish species of interest through life history information analysis, including age and growth, sex ratio, size and age of sexual maturation and transition, spawning season, fecundity, and diet. Priorities are dictated by the SEDAR schedule and other management considerations, 4.) collect hydrographic data (e.g. depth, temperature, salinity, etc.) for comparison to fish abundance and composition indices, and 5.) collect DNA samples from selected fish species for stock identification. For forty years, the Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI) at the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR), through the Marine Resources Monitoring, Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) program, has conducted fisheries-independent research on groundfish, reef fish, ichthyoplankton, and coastal pelagic fishes within the region between Cape Lookout, North Carolina, and Ft Pierce, Florida. The overall mission of the program has been to determine distribution, relative abundance, and critical habitat of economically and ecologically important fishes of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB), and to relate these features to environmental factors and exploitation activities. Research toward fulfilling these goals has included trawl surveys (from 6-350 m depth); ichthyoplankton surveys; location and mapping of reef habitat; sampling of reefs throughout the SAB; life history and population studies of priority species; tagging studies of commercially important species and special studies directed at specific management problems in the region. Survey work has also provided a monitoring program that has allowed the standardized sampling of fish populations over time and development of an historical base for future comparisons of long-term trends. MARMAP has developed a long-term database for reef fish that has proven valuable in interpreting fisheries landings data and developing regulations for protecting reef fish resources. Restrictions on minimum sizes of most commercially important species make it difficult to monitor life history parameters and abundance data from samples collected from the fishery landings. MARMAP has been the only existing long-term program off the Atlantic coast of the southeastern United States that monitors reef fish composition, length frequency, abundance, and life history based on fishery-independent data. These data provide critical input for the assessments of stock status conducted by NOAA Fisheries, and greatly assist stock assessment scientists and the Council in the management of snapper/grouper complex of the South Atlantic Bight. The abundance and biomass of fish species collected during the day from 2006 to 2010 off the coast of the southeastern United States (Cape Fear, NC to Cape Canaveral, FL) were collected using long bottom long lines. Long bottom long lines were set on the ?tilefish grounds?, generally smooth mud or clay bottoms. Long bottom long lines were constructed of 3.2 mm galvanized cable (1,525 m long), deployed from along-line reel with 1,220 m of cable used as ground line and the remaining 305 m buoyed to the surface. A 10-11 kg weight was attached to the ground line, dropped into the water, and 100 gangions (comprised of an AKsnap, approximately 0.5 m of 90 kg monofilament and a tuna circle hook) were subsequently attached at 12 m intervals to the ground line. Another 10-11 kg weight was then attached at the terminal end of the ground line (buoy end) and the remaining 305 m of cable was buoyed to the surface with 1 or 2 polyball buoys attached to a10 m trailer line. Each set was soaked between 45 and 150 minutes. Sampling was conducted between 31° 14.1' N and 32° 9.2' N and -78° 59.8' W and -79° 44.1' W at depths between 176 and 261 m.</abstract>
      <purpose>This dataset was created for the purpose of describing the distribution and relative abundance of the numerically dominant and economically important deep-water finfish species in southeastern coastal waters so that these biological resources can be considered for any planned energy development or other coastal use activities.</purpose>

        <procdesc>Field Data Collection: From 1996 to present, the long bottom long lines were constructed of 3.2-mm galvanized cable (1525 m long), deployed from a long line reel with 1220 m of cable used as ground line and the remaining 305 m buoyed to the surface. The ground line consisted of an 10 kg weight attached to the terminal end, 100 gangions (comprising of an AK snap, approximately 0.5 m of 90 kg monofilament and a tuna circle hook at 12-m intervals) attached to the ground line, and another weight at the ground line?s buoy end and the remaining 305 m of cable was buoyed to the surface with 1 or 2 polyball buoys attached to a10 m trailer line. From 1982 through 1987 hook sizes were either #5, #7 or #9; after 1996 the hook sizes were either #5 or #7. Hooks were baited (double hooked) with whole squid (Illex sp. or Loligo sp.). Bottom long lines were deployed by adding an 11 kg weight to the terminal end, dropping the weight into the water, and then attaching 100 gangions with a spacing of 12 m between gangions as the ground line came off the reel. After all gangions were attached, an 11 kg weight was attached to the ground line and the remaining 305 m of cable was buoyed to the surface with 1 or 2 polyball buoys and a Hi-Flyer buoy attached to a 10 m trailer line. Long bottom long lines were deployed while running with the current at a speed of 4-5 knots in areas of smooth bottom with mud substrate (e.g. tilefish grounds). Each line soaked between 45 and 90 minutes and was retrieved using a hydraulic pot hauler. Sampling was between 31° 14.1' N and 32° 9.2' N and -78° 59.8' W and -79° 44.1' W at depths between 176 and 261 m. All individuals in each catch are sorted and identified to species level. All individuals of each species are weighed together, while length is individually measured for all fish. All Individuals of selected species are kept for life history work-up. All other fish are returned to the ocean. For any given species, a catch per unit effort (CPUE) is calculated for any 1 x 1 minute grid cell that was sampled by the MARMAP program within the 5 year time frame (2006-2010). All catches used in the calculations were from long lines that were soaked between 45 and 150 minutes. CPUE was calculated as the number of a selected species caught per 100 hooks per hour of soak time. The number of sets, the percent occurrence (the number of positive sets divided by the number of available sets, and coefficient of variance for CPUE was calculated for each 1 x 1 minute grid cell.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>GIS processing: 1.) One point layer per species was created where each point was the mid-point of a 1 x 1 minute grid cell where there was MARMAP sampling between 2006-2010. 2.) A 1 x 1 min. grid of the whole offshore study area was created. 3.) A spatial selection was performed to select those 1 x 1 min. grid cells that contained MARMAP mid-points. A new layer was created with just the selected grid cells. 4.) The mid-points from the species layer were spatially joined to the 1 x 1 min. grid layer to create a final grid layer per species.</procdesc>

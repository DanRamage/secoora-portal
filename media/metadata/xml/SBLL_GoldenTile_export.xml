      <abstract>Marine Spatial Data: This dataset came from the Marine Resources Monitoring, Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) program which has conducted fisheries-independent research for the last 35+ years off the southeastern United States. This dataset was based on a five year time frame (2006-2010). The data were summarized into 1 x 1 minute latitude/longitude grids which provide the number of collections, percent occurrence, mean catch per unit effort (CPUE), and the coefficient of variance for the CPUE. General MARMAP overview: Annual MARMAP cruises to assess relative abundance of reef fishes in the sponge-coral and shelf edge (live bottom) habitats of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) have been conducted since 1978. MARMAP currently samples natural live bottom habitat from Cape Lookout, NC to the Ft. Pierce area, FL. The current main MARMAP objectives are to: 1.) sample reef fishes in the snapper-grouper complex at using a variety of gears in live bottom, rocky outcrop, high relief, and mud bottom habitats, 2.) collect detailed data for time series description of species for annual composition and relative abundance, 3.) obtain population characteristics on fish species of interest through life history information analysis, including age and growth, sex ratio, size and age of sexual maturation and transition, spawning season, fecundity, and diet. Priorities are dictated by the SEDAR schedule and other management considerations, 4.) collect hydrographic data (e.g. depth, temperature, salinity, etc.) for comparison to fish abundance and composition indices, and 5.) collect DNA samples from selected fish species for stock identification. For thirty years, the Marine Resources Research Institute (MRRI) at the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR), through the Marine Resources Monitoring, Assessment and Prediction (MARMAP) program, has conducted fisheries-independent research on groundfish, reef fish, ichthyoplankton, and coastal pelagic fishes within the region between Cape Lookout, North Carolina, and Ft Pierce, Florida. The overall mission of the program has been to determine distribution, relative abundance, and critical habitat of economically and ecologically important fishes of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB), and to relate these features to environmental factors and exploitation activities. Research toward fulfilling these goals has included trawl surveys (from 6-350 m depth); ichthyoplankton surveys; location and mapping of reef habitat; sampling of reefs throughout the SAB; life history and population studies of priority species; tagging studies of commercially important species and special studies directed at specific management problems in the region. Survey work has also provided a monitoring program that has allowed the standardized sampling of fish populations over time and development of an historical base for future comparisons of long-term trends. MARMAP has developed a long-term database for reef fish that has proven valuable in interpreting fisheries landings data and developing regulations for protecting reef fish resources. Restrictions on minimum sizes of most commercially important species make it difficult to monitor life history parameters and abundance data from samples collected from the fishery landings. MARMAP has been the only existing long-term program off the Atlantic coast of the southeastern United States that monitors reef fish composition, length frequency, abundance, and life history based on fishery-independent data. These data provide critical input for the assessments of stock status conducted by NOAA Fisheries, and greatly assist stock assessment scientists and the Council in the management of snapper/grouper complex of the South Atlantic Bight. The abundance and biomass of fish species collected during the day from 2006 to 2010 off the coast of the southeastern United States (Cape Fear, NC to Cape Canaveral, FL) were collected using short bottom long lines. The short bottom long line consists of 25.6 m of 6.4 mm diameter treated solid braid Dacron (polyester) ground line dipped in green copper naphthenate. Twenty gangions with non-offset circle hooks (almost exclusively #5 Eagle claw size) at intervals of approximately 1.2 m. Upon deployment we tethered the ground line to the surface using an 8 mm (5/16 inch) polypropylene line attached to a polyball buoy. The buoy was attached to a hi-flyer buoy using a 10 m trailer line. The line was deployed by stretching the ground line along the vessel's gunwale with 10-11 kg weights attached at each end of the line. The gangions consisted of an AK snap, 0.5 m of 90 kg monofilament and a tuna circle hook, and were baited (double hooked) with a whole squid (Illex sp. or Loligo sp.). Soak time was approximately 90 minutes, after which the gear was retrieved utilizing a hydraulic pot hauler. The short bottom long lines were generally deployed in sets of six, with each long line attached to its own surface polyball and highflyer buoy and not connected to any other long line.</abstract>
      <purpose>This GIS dataset was created for the purpose of describing the distribution and relative abundance of the numerically dominant and economically important deep-water finfish species in southeastern coastal waters so that these biological resources can be considered for any planned energy development or other coastal use activities.</purpose>

        <procdesc>Field Data Collection: The short bottom long line consists of 25.6 m of 6.4 mm diameter treated solid braid Dacron (polyester) ground line dipped in green copper naphthenate. Twenty gangions with non-offset circle hooks (almost exclusively #5 Eagle claw size) at intervals of approximately 1.2 m.

The buoy was attached to a hi-flyer buoy using a 10 m trailer line.

The gangions consisted of an AK snap, 0.5 m of 90 kg monofilament and a tuna circle hook, and were baited (double hooked) with a whole squid (Illex sp. or Loligo sp.). Soak time was approximately 90 minutes, after which the gear was retrieved utilizing a hydraulic pot hauler. The short bottom long lines were generally deployed in sets of six, with each long line attached to its own surface polyball and hi-flyer buoy and not connected to any other long line. Up to six long lines, separated by a minimum distance of 200 m, are fished at the same time. All individuals in each line are sorted and identified to species level. All individuals of each species are weighed together, while length is individually measured for all fish. All Individuals of selected species are kept for life history work-up. All other fish are returned to the ocean. For any given species, a catch per unit effort (CPUE) is calculated for any 1 x 1 minute grid cell that was sampled by the MARMAP program within the 5 year time frame (2006-2010). All catches used in the calculations were from sets that were soaked between 45 and 150 minutes. CPUE was calculated as the number of a selected species caught per 20 hooks per hour of soak time. The number of set, the percent occurrence (the number of positive traps divided by the number of available sets), and coefficient of variance for CPUE was calculated for each 1 x 1 minute grid cell.</procdesc>

        <procdesc>GIS processing: 1.) One point layer per species was created where each point was the mid-point of a 1 x 1 minute grid cell where there was MARMAP sampling between 2006-2010 (within the SC offshore study area of 32 to 34 degrees N). 2.) A 1 x 1 min. grid of the whole offshore study area was created. 3.) A spatial selection was performed to select those 1 x 1 min. grid cells that contained MARMAP mid-points. A new layer was created with just the selected grid cells. 4.) The mid-points from the species layer were spatially joined to the 1 x 1 min. grid layer to create a final grid layer per species.</procdesc>

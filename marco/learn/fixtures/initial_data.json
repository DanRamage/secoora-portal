Erosion is a natural process on many coastal beaches, but it can be exacerbate by human changes such as dredging and maintenance of inlets and development. One mechanism to manage erosion is through beach renourishment, appropriate sand resources are  identified offshore and then pumped onshore to replenish the beach area. Completing a beach renourishment project requires detailed understanding of sand availablility, type and location; as well as, potential impacts to natural resources (e.g. sea turtles and shorebirds) and other uses in the area."

These ports require regular dredging to maintain their shipping lanes.  The widening of the Panama Canal is changing the maritime industry in the southeast, enabling the transit of larger ships and therefore increasing the size of ships visiting our ports.  Ports from Charleston to Miami are in the process of evaluating the feasibility of deepening their shipping lanes in response. A variety of information goes into making these decisions including environmental impacts, capacity to transport goods inland, and sediment disposal options. "

The Nature Conservancy developed this science-based ecoregional assessment for the Northwest Atlantic Marine region (Bay of Fundy to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina). This assessment synthesizes information on oceanography, chemistry, geology, biology, and social science to inform decisions about coastal and marine ecosystems. By integrating this information at a regional level, the Conservancy is able to provide both a greater understanding of the interrelated biological diversity of the marine ecoregion, and a clearer picture of the current condition of its natural areas and the challenges to their continued persistence. The ten categories of targets identified as the primary structure for the marine ecoregional assessment are:\u00a0\u00a0coastal and estuarine habitats, benthic habitats, diadromous fish, demersal fish, pelagic fish, forage fish, nearshore shellfish, shorebirds and seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles. Geospatial data obtained from the United States Navy included point shapefiles of valid sightings for numerous marine mammal and turtle species and pre-calculated effort grids for each season. Sightings data were taken from NMFS-NEFSC Aerial Surveys, NMFSNEFSC Shipboard Surveys, and the North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium database. The validity of sightings was carefully screened and verified by United States Navy contractors before inclusion in the model. Invalid records were not included in the analysis. Sightings for each ten minute square were divided by the effort for each ten minute square to calculate Sightings Per Unit Effort (SPUE).  SPUE was calculated for each species, for each season, and for each ten minute square."

This application is based on their Marine Mammal and Seabird Computer Database Analysis System (MMS-CDAS). The origin of the underlying data is a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service aerial survey conducted between December, 2001 and March, 2003. <br><br>All waterbird species in the USFWS database from winter surveys only were exported to density blocks. Information in the MMS application suggests the winter surveys only are valid for calculating densities because they were flown on specific transects. The spatial extent of the database (and thus of this data set) is from the Virginia/North Carolina border to the Hudson Canyon (including Delaware Bay and the lowest part of Chesapeake Bay)."

The ten categories of targets identified as the primary structure for the marine ecoregional assessment are:\u00a0\u00a0coastal and estuarine habitats, benthic habitats, diadromous fish, demersal fish, pelagic fish, forage fish, nearshore shellfish, shorebirds and seabirds, marine mammals, and sea turtles. <br><br>\r\nSeabed forms classify seafloor topography into discrete units. Derived from The Nature Conservancy's derived digital bathymetry, seabed forms can be described by a combination of just two variables: seabed position and slope. Seabed position (also referred to as topographic position or slope position) describes the topography of the area surrounding a particular cell. We based our seabed position calculations on Fels and Zobel's (1995) method, which evaluates the elevation differences between the model cell and the surrounding cells within a specified distance."

WEAs are offshore locations that appear most suitable for wind energy development. Secretary Salazar identified the WEAs on February 7, 2011 in a joint announcement with Secretary Chu of the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the National Strategic Work Plan for Offshore Wind. Data has been and will continue to be collected for these high priority areas to inform government and industry assessments and planning, allowing a more efficient process for permitting and siting responsible development. Requests for Interest (RFIs) and Calls for Information have been or will be issued for these new WEAs to support lease sale environmental assessments."

The data were created by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and AWS Truepower. Wind speed data for all of the MARCO states was created as part of onshore wind mapping projects. Speed data was extrapolated to 50 nautical miles offshore by NREL. The 90 m wind speed was calculated by a linear interpolation between 70 m and 100 m wind speeds. A horizontal discontinuity (seam) in the wind resource is present at the border of New York and New Jersey. Discontinuities in the data result from offshore data that is based on different versions of the numerical model used for the different onshore mapping projects and the way the extrapolation software interprets the data on either side of the seam."

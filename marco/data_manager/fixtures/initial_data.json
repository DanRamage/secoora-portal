Important species include menhaden, sea scallop, surf clam, ocean quahog clam, summer flounder, lobster, squid, and striped bass. An estimated 2.6 million recreational anglers participated in 17 million saltwater fishing trips in 2009, mainly targeting striped bass, summer flounder, black seabass, tautog, scup, bluefish, drum, weakfish, spot, and croaker. Data compiled here represent fishing effort and are derived from National Marine Fisheries Service Fishing Vessel Trip Reports.

Benthic habitats are combinations of EMUs considered with their species assemblages. Thresholds were created by classifying grab samples into organism groups based on similarities in the composition and abundance of the benthic species using hierarchical cluster analysis. To perform this analysis, each grab sample was classified to an organism group, then overlaid on standardized base maps of depth, sediment grain size and seabed forms, and attributed with the information taken from the classified data. Regression trees were built individually for each physical variable to identify critical thresholds that separated sets of organism groups from each other. Regression trees were also built using all variables collectively to identify which variables were driving the organism differences. Each analysis was performed separately by ecological subregion after data exploration revealed that the relationships between genera and physical factors differed markedly among subregions.",

The density grid was created using tracklines that were generated from a 2009 AIS Database using a custom built trackline tool. Vessel tracklines were created separately for each month using the file geodatabases for UTM zones 18 and 19. A unique density grid was created for each combination of month and UTM zone. These grids were then summed together and clipped to the Mid-Atlantic region. To simplify display in on-line data viewers, the summed floating point grid was reclassified into 7 discrete classes using increments of 1/2 standard deviations from the mean density value from 1/2 to 3 standard deviations.",

Wind speed data for all of the MARCO states was created as part of onshore wind mapping projects. Speed data was extrapolated to 50 nautical miles offshore by NREL. The 90 m wind speed was calculated by a linear interpolation between 70 m and 100 m wind speeds. A horizontal discontinuity (seam) in the wind resource is present at the border of New York and New Jersey. Discontinuities in the data result from offshore data that is based on different versions of the numerical model used for the different onshore mapping projects and the way the extrapolation software interprets the data on either side of the seam.

To perform this analysis, each grab sample was classified to an organism group, then overlaid on standardized base maps of depth, sediment grain size and seabed forms, and attributed with the information taken from the classified data. Regression trees were built individually for each physical variable to identify critical thresholds that separated sets of organism groups from each other. Regression trees were also built using all variables collectively to identify which variables were driving the organism differences. Each analysis was performed separately by ecological subregion after data exploration revealed that the relationships between genera and physical factors differed markedly among subregions.",

Information in the MMS application suggests the winter surveys only are valid for calculating densities because they were flown on specific transects.
